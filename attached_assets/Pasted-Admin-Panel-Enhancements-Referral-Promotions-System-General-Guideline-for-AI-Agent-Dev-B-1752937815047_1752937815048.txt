Admin Panel Enhancements – Referral & Promotions System
🧠 General Guideline for AI Agent / Dev
⚠️ Before creating any new feature/module:

Check if a similar function or module already exists in the admin panel.

If found, enhance or extend the existing module.

Avoid duplication — use existing schema, components, and structure wherever possible.

🛠️ 1. Technician Referral Program
[Purpose] Allow technicians to earn rewards by referring other technicians.

[Agent Instructions]

Look for existing referral program logic, likely under "Technicians" or "Settings".

Confirm if referral codes and tracking are already present.

If present, enhance to include:

Per-region referral reward settings.

View referral stats for each technician (e.g. who they referred, total earnings).

Ability for Region Admin to:

Toggle referral program ON/OFF

Set reward amount (currency-based)

If not found, create a new Technician Referral section under "Technician Management" or "Rewards".

🛠️ 2. Promotions / Coupon System for Customer Acquisition
[Purpose] Region Admins can launch customer-focused promotions (e.g., coupon codes, discounts).

[Agent Instructions]

First, search admin panel for any of the following:

"Promotions"

"Coupons"

"Discount Codes"

Any marketing-related modules

If found, extend functionality to support:

Region-based creation and management

Code types: % Discount, Fixed Discount, Free Service, First Booking Bonus

Validity period, usage limits, and audience targeting (e.g., new users only)

If not found, create a new section:

Module Name: Customer Promotions

Access Level: Region Admin only

Monitor usage analytics

Set:
