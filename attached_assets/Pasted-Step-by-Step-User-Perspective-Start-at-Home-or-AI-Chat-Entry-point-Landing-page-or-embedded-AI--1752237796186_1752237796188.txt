Step-by-Step (User Perspective):
Start at Home or AI Chat

Entry point: Landing page or embedded AI assistant asks:

"Hi! What kind of help do you need today? (AI answer, live help, or technician on-site?)"

Show 3 big buttons:

🔧 Talk to AI (Free)

💬 Live Chat Support

🧑‍🔧 Request Technician

Click: “Request Technician”

Show a simple 3-step wizard:

Select Category (Hardware, Network, Software, etc.)

Describe Issue Briefly (Optional: 2-line text box)

Enter Zip Code / Location (Auto-detect if allowed)

Technician Matching Screen

Show matched technician(s) with:

Name, skills, rating

“Available Now” badge

“View Profile” / “Request Service” button

Request Booking

User selects technician or clicks Auto-Match

Choose:

Time Slot (ASAP or scheduled)

Contact Info Confirmation

Show price estimate and payment options

Confirmation + Tracking

After booking, user sees:

Technician ETA

Live status (Dispatched → On Route → In Progress)

Chat/Call button for technician

🛠️ Suggested Implementation Tips (Developer Notes):
1. Direct Technician Path Toggle
Add /?path=technician or dedicated route /technician

Bypass AI chat and directly open the technician flow

2. Auto-Skip AI Escalation for “Technician” Keywords
In AI chat logic, if user types:

“I need someone to come fix it” or “Send a technician”

Immediately skip to Step 2 of the wizard above

3. Minimal Category/Issue Steps
Instead of 9 categories + 63 subcategories upfront, simplify:

Show just the 9 top categories

Subcategories can be inferred later or handled by technician

4. Use Default Options Where Possible
Default pricing tier (Medium priority)

Auto-fill location from browser

Auto-select nearest available technician

🧠 Optional: Voice UI (Future Enhancement)
Let users speak the issue, and NLP turns it into structured data:

"My Wi-Fi is broken in my apartment in Brooklyn"
→ Category: Network → Location: Brooklyn → Escalate to Technician

📋 Summary (as bullet for product spec):
🎯 Entry points: Home → Technician (1-click)

🧭 Flow: Category → Description → Location → Match → Book

🧠 Use AI only where helpful (triage / fallback)

🧱 Avoid deep menus, use wizards and auto-fill
